\chapter[Markov Chains]{Markov Chains}

% Introduction
\chapterinitial{M}{any} real world situations have some level of
unpredictability through randomness: the flip of a coin, the number of orders of
coffee in a shop, the winning numbers of the lottery. However, mathematics can
in fact let us make predictions about what can be expected to happen. One tool used to
understand randomness is Markov chains, an area of mathematics sitting at the
intersection of probability and linear algebra.

\section{Problem}\label{sec:problem}

Consider a barber shop. The shop owners have noticed that customers will not
wait if there is no room in their waiting room and will choose to take their
business elsewhere. The Barber shop would like to make an investment so as to
avoid this situation. They know the following information:

\begin{itemize}
    \item They currently have 2 barber chairs (and 2 barbers).
    \item They have waiting room for 4 people.
    \item They usually have 10 customers arrive per hour.
    \item Each Barber takes about 15 minutes to serve a customer so they can
        serve 4 customers an hour.
\end{itemize}

This is represented diagrammatically in Figure~\ref{fig:barber-shop}.

\begin{figure}[!hbtp]

    \end{center}
    \caption{Diagrammatic representation of the barber shop as a queuing system.}
    \label{fig:barber-shop}
\end{figure}


They are planning on
reconfiguring space to either have 2 extra waiting chairs or
another barber's chair and barber.

The mathematical tool used here to model this situation is a Markov chain.

\section{Theory}\label{sec:theory}

A Markov chain is a model of a sequence of random events that is defined by a
collection of \textbf{states} and rules that define how to move between these
states.

For example, in the barber shop a single number is sufficient to describe the
status of the shop: the number of customers present.
If that number is 1 this implies that 1 customer is
currently having their hair cut. If that number is 5 this implies that 2
customers are being served and 3 are waiting. The entire set of values that this value can take
is
a finite set of integers from 0 to 6, this set, in general, is called the \textit{state space}.
If the system is full (all barbers
and waiting room occupied) then the Markov chain is in state 6 and if there is no one at the
shop then it is in state 0. This is denoted mathematically as:

\begin{equation}
    S = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}
    \label{eqn:barber_shop_state_space}
\end{equation}

The state increases when people arrive and this happens at a rate of change of
10. The state decrease when people are served and this happens at a rate of 4
per active server. In both cases it is assumed that no 2 events can occur at
the same time.

The rules that govern how to move between these states can be defined in 2
ways:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Using probabilities of changing state (or not) in a well defined time
        interval. This is called a discrete Markov chain.
    \item Using rates of change from one state to another. This is called a
        continuous time Markov chain.
\end{itemize}

The barber shop will be considered as a continuous Markov chain as shown
in Figure~\ref{fig:barber-shop-continuous-markov-process}

\begin{figure}[!hbtp]
    \begin{center}
    \includestandalone[width=.6\textwidth]{./assets/barber-shop-continuous-markov-process/main}
    \end{center}
    \caption{Diagrammatic representation of the state space and the transition
    rates}
    \label{fig:barber-shop-continuous-markov-process}
\end{figure}

Note that a Markov chain assumes the rates follow an exponential distribution.
One interesting property of this distribution is that it is considered
memoryless which means the probability of a customer finishing service
within the next 5 minutes does not change if they have been
having their hair cut for 3 minutes already.

These states and rates can be represented mathematically using a transition
matrix \(Q\) where \(Q_{ij}\) represents the rate of going from state \(i\) to
state \(j\). In this case:

\begin{equation}
Q =
\begin{pmatrix}
-10 &  10 &   0 &   0 &   0 &   0 &   0\\
  4 & -14 &  10 &   0 &   0 &   0 &   0\\
  0 &   8 & -18 &  10 &   0 &   0 &   0\\
  0 &   0 &   8 & -18 &  10 &   0 &   0\\
  0 &   0 &   0 &   8 & -18 &  10 &   0\\
  0 &   0 &   0 &   0 &   8 & -18 &  10\\
  0 &   0 &   0 &   0 &   0 &   8 &  -8\\
 \end{pmatrix}
 \label{eqn:barber_shop_transition_matrix}
\end{equation}

You will see that \(Q_{ii}\) are negative and ensure the rows of \(Q\) sum to 0.
This gives the total rate of change leaving state \(i\).

The matrix \(Q\) can be used to understand the probability of being in a given state after
\(t\) time unis. This is can be represented mathematically using a matrix
\(P_{t}\) where \((P_{t})_{ij}\) is the probability of being in state \(j\)
after \(t\) time units having started in state \(i\). Using a mathematical tool
called the matrix exponential % TODO Add footnote pointing at texts on matrix exponential
the value of \(P_{t}\) can be calculated numerically.

\begin{equation}
    P_t = e^{Qt}
    \label{eqn:continuous_time_markov_process_matrix_exponential}
\end{equation}

What is also useful is understanding the long run behaviour of the
system. This allows us to answer questions such as ``what state is the system most
likely to be in on average?'' or ``what is the probability of being in the last
state on average?''.

This long run probability distribution over the state can be represented using a
vector \(\pi\) where \(\pi_i\) represents the probability of being in state
\(i\). This vector is in fact the solution to the following matrix equation:

\begin{equation}
    \pi Q = 0
    \label{eqn:continuous_time_markov_process_steady_state}
\end{equation}

with the following constraint:

\begin{equation}
    \sum_{i=1}^{n}\pi_i = 1
\end{equation}

In the upcoming sections all of the above concepts will be demonstrate.

\section{Solving with Python}\label{sec:solving-with-python}

The first step is to write a function to obtain the transition
rates between 2 given states:


\begin{pyin}
def get_transition_rate(
    in_state,
    out_state,
    waiting_room=4,
    num_barbers=2,
):
    """Return the transition rate for 2 given states.

    Args:
        in_state: an integer
        out_state: an integer
        waiting_room: an integer (default: 4)
        num_barbers:  an integer (default: 2)

    Returns:
        A real.
    """
    arrival_rate = 10
    service_rate = 4
    capacity = waiting_room + num_barbers
    delta = out_state - in_state

    if delta == 1 and in_state < capacity:
        return arrival_rate

    if delta == -1:
        return min(in_state, num_barbers) * service_rate

    return 0
\end{pyin}

Next, a function that creates an entire transition rate matrix \(Q\) for a given
problem is written. The \mintinline{python}{numpy} library will be used to
handle all the linear algebra and the \mintinline{python}{itertools} library for
some iterations:

\begin{pyin}
import itertools
import numpy as np


def get_transition_rate_matrix(waiting_room=4, num_barbers=2):
    """Return the transition matrix Q.

    Args:
        waiting_room: an integer (default: 4)
        num_barbers: an integer (default: 2)

    Returns:
        A matrix.
    """
    capacity = waiting_room + num_barbers
    state_pairs = itertools.product(
        range(capacity + 1), repeat=2
    )
    flat_transition_rates = [
        get_transition_rate(
            in_state=in_state,
            out_state=out_state,
            waiting_room=waiting_room,
            num_barbers=num_barbers,
        )
        for in_state, out_state in state_pairs
    ]
    transition_rates = np.reshape(
        flat_transition_rates, (capacity + 1, capacity + 1)
    )
    np.fill_diagonal(
        transition_rates, -transition_rates.sum(axis=1)
    )

    return transition_rates
\end{pyin}

Using this the matrix \(Q\) for the default system can be obtained:

\begin{pyin}
Q = get_transition_rate_matrix()
print(Q)
\end{pyin}

which gives:

\begin{pyout}
[[-10  10   0   0   0   0   0]
 [  4 -14  10   0   0   0   0]
 [  0   8 -18  10   0   0   0]
 [  0   0   8 -18  10   0   0]
 [  0   0   0   8 -18  10   0]
 [  0   0   0   0   8 -18  10]
 [  0   0   0   0   0   8  -8]]
\end{pyout}

Here, the matrix exponential will be used as
discussed above, using the \mintinline{python}{scipy}
library. To see what would happen after .5 time units:

\begin{pyin}
import scipy.linalg

print(scipy.linalg.expm(Q * 0.5).round(5))
\end{pyin}

which gives:

\begin{pyout}
[[0.10492 0.21254 0.20377 0.17142 0.13021 0.09564 0.0815 ]
 [0.08501 0.18292 0.18666 0.1708  0.14377 0.1189  0.11194]
 [0.06521 0.14933 0.16338 0.16478 0.15633 0.14751 0.15346]
 [0.04388 0.10931 0.13183 0.15181 0.16777 0.18398 0.21142]
 [0.02667 0.07361 0.10005 0.13422 0.17393 0.2189  0.27262]
 [0.01567 0.0487  0.07552 0.11775 0.17512 0.24484 0.32239]
 [0.01068 0.03668 0.06286 0.10824 0.17448 0.25791 0.34914]]
\end{pyout}

To see what would happen after 500 time units:

\begin{pyin}
print(scipy.linalg.expm(Q * 500).round(5))
\end{pyin}

which gives:

\begin{pyout}
[[0.03431 0.08577 0.10722 0.13402 0.16752 0.2094  0.26176]
 [0.03431 0.08577 0.10722 0.13402 0.16752 0.2094  0.26176]
 [0.03431 0.08577 0.10722 0.13402 0.16752 0.2094  0.26176]
 [0.03431 0.08577 0.10722 0.13402 0.16752 0.2094  0.26176]
 [0.03431 0.08577 0.10722 0.13402 0.16752 0.2094  0.26176]
 [0.03431 0.08577 0.10722 0.13402 0.16752 0.2094  0.26176]
 [0.03431 0.08577 0.10722 0.13402 0.16752 0.2094  0.26176]]
\end{pyout}

No matter what state (row) the system is in,
after 500 time units, the probability of ending up in each state (columns) is
the same regardless of the state the system began in (row).

The analysis can in fact be stopped here
however the choice of 500 time units was arbitrary and might not be the correct
amount for all possible scenarios, as such the
underlying equation~\ref{eqn:continuous_time_markov_process_steady_state}
directly.

The underlying linear system will be solved using a numerically efficient
algorithm called least squares optimisation (available from the
\mintinline{python}{numpy} library):

\begin{pyin}
def get_steady_state_vector(Q):
    """Return the steady state vector of any given continuous
    time transition rate matrix.

    Args:
       Q: a transition rate matrix

    Returns:
        A vector
    """
    state_space_size, _ = Q.shape
    A = np.vstack((Q.T, np.ones(state_space_size)))
    b = np.append(np.zeros(state_space_size), 1)
    x, _, _, _ = np.linalg.lstsq(A, b, rcond=None)
    return x
\end{pyin}

The steady state vector for the default system is given by:

\begin{pyin}
print(get_steady_state_vector(Q).round(5))
\end{pyin}

giving:

\begin{pyout}
[0.03431 0.08577 0.10722 0.13402 0.16752 0.2094  0.26176]
\end{pyout}

This shows that the shop is expected to be empty approximately 3.4\% of the time
and full 26.2\% of the time.

The final function written is one that uses all of
the above to return the probability of the shop being full.

\begin{pyin}
def get_probability_of_full_shop(
    waiting_room=4, num_barbers=2
):
    """Return the probability of the barber shop being full.

    Args:
        waiting_room: an integer (default: 4)
        num_barbers: an integer (default: 2)

    Returns:
        A real.
    """
    Q = get_transition_rate_matrix(
        waiting_room=waiting_room,
        num_barbers=num_barbers,
    )
    pi = get_steady_state_vector(Q)
    return pi[-1]
\end{pyin}

This can now confirm the previous probability calculated probability of the shop
being full:

\begin{pyin}
print(round(get_probability_of_full_shop(), 6))
\end{pyin}

which gives:

\begin{pyout}
0.261756
\end{pyout}

Now that the models have been defined, they will be used to compare the 2
possible scenarios.

Having 2 extra space in the waiting room corresponds to:

\begin{pyin}
print(round(get_probability_of_full_shop(waiting_room=6), 6))
\end{pyin}

which gives:

\begin{pyout}
0.23557
\end{pyout}

This is a slight improvement however, increasing the number of barbers has a
substantial effect:

\begin{pyin}
print(round(get_probability_of_full_shop(num_barbers=3), 6))
\end{pyin}

\begin{pyout}
0.078636
\end{pyout}

Therefore, it would be better to increase the number of barbers by 1
than to increase the waiting room capacity by 2.

\section{Solving with R}\label{sec:solving-with-R}

The first step taken is to write a function to obtain the transition rates
between 2 given states:

\begin{Rin}
#' Return the transition rate for 2 given states.
#'
#' @param in_state an integer
#' @param out_state an integer
#' @param waiting_room an integer (default: 4)
#' @param num_barbers an integer  (default: 2)
#'
#' @return A real
get_transition_rate <- function(in_state,
                                out_state,
                                waiting_room = 4,
                                num_barbers = 2){
  arrival_rate <- 10
  service_rate <- 4
  capacity <- waiting_room + num_barbers
  delta <- out_state - in_state

  if (delta == 1) {
    if (in_state < capacity) {
      return(arrival_rate)
    }
  }
  if (delta == -1) {
    return(min(in_state, num_barbers) * service_rate)
  }
  return(0)
}
\end{Rin}

This actual function will not be used but instead a vectorized version of this
makes calculations more efficient:  % TODO Add footnote reference on vectorization

\begin{Rin}
vectorized_get_transition_rate <- Vectorize(
  get_transition_rate,
  vectorize.args = c("in_state", "out_state")
)
\end{Rin}

This function can now take a vector of inputs for the \mintinline{R}{in_state}
and \mintinline{R}{out_state} variables which will allow us to simplify the
following code that creates the matrices:

\begin{Rin}
#' Return the transition rate matrix Q
#'
#' @param waiting_room an integer (default: 4)
#' @param num_barbers an integer (default: 2)
#'
#' @return A matrix
get_transition_rate_matrix <- function(waiting_room = 4,
                                       num_barbers = 2){
  max_state <- waiting_room + num_barbers

  Q <- outer(
    0:max_state,
    0:max_state,
    vectorized_get_transition_rate,
    waiting_room = waiting_room,
    num_barbers = num_barbers
  )
  row_sums <- rowSums(Q)
  diag(Q) <- -row_sums
  Q
}
\end{Rin}

Using this the matrix \(Q\) for the default system can be used:

\begin{Rin}
Q <- get_transition_rate_matrix()
print(Q)
\end{Rin}

which gives:

\begin{Rout}
     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] [,7]
[1,]  -10   10    0    0    0    0    0
[2,]    4  -14   10    0    0    0    0
[3,]    0    8  -18   10    0    0    0
[4,]    0    0    8  -18   10    0    0
[5,]    0    0    0    8  -18   10    0
[6,]    0    0    0    0    8  -18   10
[7,]    0    0    0    0    0    8   -8
\end{Rout}

One immediate thing that can be done with this matrix is to take the matrix exponential
discussed above. To do this, an R library called
\mintinline{R}{expm} will be used.

To be able to make use of the nice \mintinline{R}{%>%}
``pipe'' operator the \mintinline{R}{magrittr} library will be loaded.
Now if to see what would happen after .5 time units:

\begin{Rin}
library(expm, warn.conflicts = FALSE, quietly = TRUE)
library(magrittr, warn.conflicts = FALSE, quietly = TRUE)

print( (Q * .5) %>% expm %>% round(5))
\end{Rin}

which gives:

\begin{Rout}
        [,1]    [,2]    [,3]    [,4]    [,5]    [,6]    [,7]
[1,] 0.10492 0.21254 0.20377 0.17142 0.13021 0.09564 0.08150
[2,] 0.08501 0.18292 0.18666 0.17080 0.14377 0.11890 0.11194

[6,] 0.01567 0.04870 0.07552 0.11775 0.17512 0.24484 0.32239
[7,] 0.01068 0.03668 0.06286 0.10824 0.17448 0.25791 0.34914
\end{Rout}

After 500 time units:

\begin{Rin}
print( (Q * 500) %>% expm %>% round(5))
\end{Rin}

which gives:

\begin{Rout}
        [,1]    [,2]    [,3]    [,4]    [,5]   [,6]    [,7]
[1,] 0.03431 0.08577 0.10722 0.13402 0.16752 0.2094 0.26176
[2,] 0.03431 0.08577 0.10722 0.13402 0.16752 0.2094 0.26176
[3,] 0.03431 0.08577 0.10722 0.13402 0.16752 0.2094 0.26176
[4,] 0.03431 0.08577 0.10722 0.13402 0.16752 0.2094 0.26176
[5,] 0.03431 0.08577 0.10722 0.13402 0.16752 0.2094 0.26176
[6,] 0.03431 0.08577 0.10722 0.13402 0.16752 0.2094 0.26176
[7,] 0.03431 0.08577 0.10722 0.13402 0.16752 0.2094 0.26176
\end{Rout}

No matter what state (row) the system is in,
after 500 time units, the probability of ending up in each state (columns) is
the same regardless of the state the system began in (row).

The analysis can in fact be stopped here
however the choice of 500 time units was arbitrary and might not be the correct
amount for all possible scenarios, as such the
underlying equation~\ref{eqn:continuous_time_markov_process_steady_state}
directly.

To be able to do this, the versatile \mintinline{R}{pracma} package will be used
which includes a number of numerical analysis functions for efficient
computations.

\begin{Rin}
library(pracma, warn.conflicts = FALSE, quietly = TRUE)

#' Return the steady state vector of any given continuous time
#' transition rate matrix
#'
#' @param Q a transition rate matrix
#'
#' @return A vector
get_steady_state_vector <- function(Q){
  state_space_size <- dim(Q)[1]
  A <- rbind(t(Q), 1)
  b <- c(integer(state_space_size), 1)
  mldivide(A, b)
}
\end{Rin}

This is making use of \mintinline{R}{pracma}'s \mintinline{R}{mldivide} function
which chooses the best numerical algorithm to find the solution to a given
matrix equation \(Ax=b\).

The steady state vector for the default system is now given by:

\begin{Rin}
print(get_steady_state_vector(Q))
\end{Rin}

giving:

\begin{Rout}
           [,1]
[1,] 0.03430888
[2,] 0.08577220
[3,] 0.10721525
[4,] 0.13401906
[5,] 0.16752383
[6,] 0.20940479
[7,] 0.26175598
\end{Rout}

The shop is expected to be empty approximately 3.4\% of the time
and full 26.2\% of the time.

The final piece of this puzzle is to create a single function that uses all of
the above to return the probability of the shop being full.

\begin{Rin}
#' Return the probability of the barber shop being full

get_probability_of_full_shop <- function(waiting_room = 4,
                                         num_barbers = 2){
  arrival_rate <- 10
  service_rate <- 4
  pi <- get_transition_rate_matrix(
    waiting_room = waiting_room,
    num_barbers = num_barbers
    ) %>%
    get_steady_state_vector()

  capacity <- waiting_room + num_barbers
  pi[capacity + 1]
}
\end{Rin}

This confirms the previous probability calculated probability of the shop
being full:

\begin{Rin}
print(get_probability_of_full_shop())
\end{Rin}

which gives:

\begin{Rout}
[1] 0.261756
\end{Rout}

Now that the models have been defined, they will be used to compare the 2
possible scenarios.

Adding 2 extra spaces in the waiting rooms corresponds to:

\begin{Rin}
print(get_probability_of_full_shop(waiting_room = 6))
\end{Rin}

which decreases the probability of a full shop to:

\begin{Rout}
[1] 0.2355699
\end{Rout}

but adding another barber and chair:

\begin{Rin}
print(get_probability_of_full_shop(num_barbers = 3))
\end{Rin}

gives:

\begin{Rout}
[1] 0.0786359
\end{Rout}

Therefore, it would be better to increase the number of barbers by 1
than to increase the waiting room capacity by 2.
