\chapter[Differential Equations]{Differential Equations}

- Fancy paragraph about differential equations. (Speed and number)
- Problem: Describe battle equation. Will Y win? What should Y0 be to win?
- Theory: a differential equtaion is a relationship - a rule spomething must
follow, a solution ios the thing itself. Show differential equations for LBE,
Discuss what a solution would be, possibly use simple differential equation as
example (toy example: speed of car).
- Code: define equations, soolve them, plot them, answer questions
