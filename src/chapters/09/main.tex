% Introduction
\chapterinitial{I}{t} is often necessary to find the most desirable choice from
a large, or indeed, infinite set of options. Sometimes this can be done using
exact techniques but often this is not possible and we finding an almost perfect
choice quickly is just as good. This is where the field of heuristics comes in
to play.

\section{Problem}\label{sec:problem}

Consider a delivery company that needs to find itineraries for its 3 drivers. In
the past, the management team has noticed that drivers will often drive to
whichever next stop is closest but this often makes for longer deliveries.

The stops of each driver are represented in Figure~\ref{fig:tsp}.

    the game.}
\label{fig:tsp}
\end{figure}

The distance matrices are given in equations (\ref{eqn:tsp-0}-\ref{eqn:tsp-2}).

    }
\end{landscape}

The value \(d^{(k)}_{ij}\) gives the travel distance for itinerary \(k\) between
stops \(i\) and \(j\). For example, \(d^{2}_{23}=103.3\) % TODO If the distance matrix changes, this value need to be updated
indicates that the distance between the 2nd and 3rd stop in the third itinerary
is given 103.3. % TODO If the distance matrix changes, this value need to be updated

Given these parameters, we aim to find a \emph{sufficiently good} set of
itineraries that gives a low total amount of travel.

The emphasis on needing a good solution, but not necessarily the best one,
prioritising computational efficiency is where the field of heuristics comes in
to its own.
