% Introduction
\chapterinitial{I}{t} is often necessary to find the most desirable choice from
a large, or indeed, infinite set of options. Sometimes this can be done using
exact techniques but often this is not possible and finding an almost perfect
choice quickly is just as good. This is where the field of
heuristics\index{heuristics} comes in to play.

\section{Problem}\label{sec:heuristics_problem}

A delivery company needs to deliver goods to 13 different stops.
They need to find a route for a driver that stops at each of the stops
once only, then returns to the first stop, the depot.

The stops are drawn in Figure~\ref{fig:tsp}.

\begin{figure}
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=.8\textwidth]{./assets/tsp/main.pdf}
    \end{center}
    \caption{The positions of the required stops.}
    \label{fig:tsp}
\end{figure}

The relevant information is the pairwise distances between each of the stops,
which is given by the distance matrix\index{matrix} in equation (\ref{eqn:tsp}).

\tiny{
    \input{./assets/tsp/main.tex}
}
\normalsize

The value \(d_{ij}\) gives the travel distance between
stops \(i\) and \(j\). For example, \(d_{23}=67\)
indicates that the distance between the 2nd and 3rd stop in the route is 67.


The delivery company would like to find the route around the 13 stops that gives
the smallest overall travel distance.


\section{Theory}\label{sec:heuristics_theory}

This problem is called a travelling salesman
problem\index{travelling salesman problem}, which can often be inefficient to
solve using exact methods~\cite{michalewicz2013solve}.
Heuristics are a family of methods that can be used to find a find a
\emph{sufficiently good} solution, though not necessarily the optimal solution,
where the emphasis is on prioritising computational efficiency.

The heuristic approach taken here will be to use a neighbourhood search algorithm.
This algorithm works by considering a given potential solution, evaluating it
and then trying another potential solution \emph{close} to it. What \emph{close}
means depends on different approaches and problems: it is referred to as the
neighbourhood. When a new solution is considered \emph{good}\footnote{`Good' is
again a term that depends on the approach and problem.} then the search
continues from the neighbourhood of this new solution.

For this problem, the steps are to first represent a possible solution, that is
a given route between all the potential stops as a \emph{tour}. If there are 3
total stops the tour must start and stop at the first one then there are two
possible tours:

\[
    t \in \{(1, 2, 3, 1), (1, 3, 2, 1)\}
\]

Given a distance matrix \(d\) such that \(d_{ij}\) is the distance between stop
\(i\) and \(j\) the total cost of a tour is given by:

\[
    C(t)=\sum_{i=1}^{n} d_{t_i, t_{i + 1}}
\]

Thus, with:

\[
    d = \begin{pmatrix}
        0 & 1 & 3\\
        1 & 0 & 15\\
        3 & 3 & 7
        \end{pmatrix}
\]

We have:

\begin{eqnarray*}
    C((1, 2, 3, 1)) &= d_{12} + d_{23} + d_{31} = 1 + 15 + 3 = 19\\
    C((1, 3, 2, 1)) &= d_{13} + d_{32} + d_{21} = 3 + 3 + 1 = 7
\end{eqnarray*}

In general, the neighbourhood search can be written down as:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Start with a given tour: \(t\).
    \item Evaluate \(C(t)\).
    \item Identify a new \(\tilde t\) from \(t\) and accept it as a replacement
        for \(t\) if \(C(\tilde t)< C(t)\).
    \item Repeat the 3rd step until some stopping condition is met.
\end{enumerate}

This is shown diagrammatically in
Figure~\ref{fig:neighbourhood_search_flow_diagram}.

\begin{figure}[!hbtp]
    \begin{center}
        \includestandalone[width=.7\textwidth]{./assets/neighbourhood_search_flow_diagram/main}
    \end{center}
    \caption{The general neighbourhood search algorithm. \(N(t)\) refers to some
    neighbourhood of \(t\).}
    \label{fig:neighbourhood_search_flow_diagram}
\end{figure}

A number of stopping conditions can be used including some specific
overall cost or a number of total iterations of the algorithm.

The neighbourhood of a tour \(t\) is taken as some set of tours that can be
obtained from \(t\) using a specific and computationally efficient
\textbf{neighbourhood operator}.
To illustrate two such neighbourhoods operators, consider the following tour on
7 stops:

\[
    t = (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 0)
\]

One possible neighbourhood is to choose 2 stops at random and swap. For
example, the tour \(\tilde t^{(1)}\in N(t)\) is obtained by swapping the stop
labelled 2 and the stop labelled 5.

\[
    \tilde t^{(1)} = (0, 1, 5, 3, 4, 2, 6, 0)
\]

Another possible neighbourhood is to choose 2 stops at random and reverse the
order of all stops between (including) those two stops. For example, the tour
\(\tilde t^{(2)} \in N(t)\) is obtained by reversing the order of all stops between
the stop labelled 2 and the stop labelled 5.

\[
    \tilde t^{(2)} = (0, 1, 5, 4, 3, 2, 6, 0)
\]

Examples of these tours are shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:tsp-effect-of-neighbourhood-operators}.

\begin{figure}[!hbtp]

        \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{./assets/tsp-effect-of-neighbourhood-operators/main.pdf}
    \end{center}
    \caption{The effect of two neighbourhood operators on \(t\). \(\tilde t^{(1)}\) is
    obtained by swapping stops labelled 2 and 5. \(\tilde t^{(2)}\) is obtained by reversing the
    path between stops labelled 2 and 5.}

\section{Solving with Python}\label{sec:heuristics_solving-with-python}

To solve this problem using Python, functions will be written that match the
first three steps in the Section~\ref{sec:heuristics_theory}.
The first step is to write the \mintinline{python}{get_initial_candidate}
function that creates an initial tour.

\begin{pyin}
import numpy as np


def get_initial_candidate(number_of_stops, seed):
    """Return an random initial tour.

    Args:
        number_of_stops: The number of stops
        seed: An integer seed.

    Returns:
        A tour starting an ending at stop with index 0.
    """
    internal_stops = list(range(1, number_of_stops))
    np.random.seed(seed)
    np.random.shuffle(internal_stops)
    return [0] + internal_stops + [0]
\end{pyin}

This gives a random tour on 13 stops:

\begin{pyin}
number_of_stops = 13
seed = 0
initial_candidate = get_initial_candidate(
    number_of_stops=number_of_stops,
    seed=seed,
)
print(initial_candidate)
\end{pyin}

\begin{pyout}
[0, 7, 12, 5, 11, 3, 9, 2, 8, 10, 4, 1, 6, 0]
\end{pyout}

To be able to evaluate any given tour its cost must be found. Here
\mintinline{python}{get_cost} does this:

\begin{pyin}
def get_cost(tour, distance_matrix):
    """Return the cost of a tour.

    Args:
        tour: A given tuple of successive stops.
        distance_matrix: The distance matrix of the problem.

    Returns:
        The cost
    """
    return sum(
        distance_matrix[current_stop, next_stop]
        for current_stop, next_stop in zip(tour[:-1], tour[1:])
    )
\end{pyin}

\begin{pyin}
distance_matrix = np.array(
    (
        (0, 35, 35, 29, 70, 35, 42, 27, 24, 44, 58, 71, 69),
        (35, 0, 67, 32, 72, 40, 71, 56, 36, 11, 66, 70, 37),
        (35, 67, 0, 63, 64, 68, 11, 12, 56, 77, 48, 67, 94),
        (29, 32, 63, 0, 93, 8, 71, 56, 8, 33, 84, 93, 69),
        (70, 72, 64, 93, 0, 101, 56, 56, 92, 81, 16, 5, 69),
        (35, 40, 68, 8, 101, 0, 76, 62, 11, 39, 91, 101, 76),
        (42, 71, 11, 71, 56, 76, 0, 15, 65, 81, 40, 60, 94),
        (27, 56, 12, 56, 56, 62, 15, 0, 50, 66, 41, 58, 82),
        (24, 36, 56, 8, 92, 11, 65, 50, 0, 39, 81, 91, 74),
        (44, 11, 77, 33, 81, 39, 81, 66, 39, 0, 77, 79, 37),
        (58, 66, 48, 84, 16, 91, 40, 41, 81, 77, 0, 20, 73),
        (71, 70, 67, 93, 5, 101, 60, 58, 91, 79, 20, 0, 65),
        (69, 37, 94, 69, 69, 76, 94, 82, 74, 37, 73, 65, 0),
    )
)
cost = get_cost(
    tour=initial_candidate,
    distance_matrix=distance_matrix,
)
print(cost)
\end{pyin}

\begin{pyout}
827
\end{pyout}

Now a function for neighbourhood operator will be written,
\mintinline{python}{swap_stops}, that swaps two stops in a given tour.

\begin{pyin}
def swap_stops(tour):
    """Return a new tour by swapping two stops.

    Args:
        tour: A given tuple of successive stops.

    Returns:
        A tour
    """
    number_of_stops = len(tour) - 1
    i, j = np.random.choice(range(1, number_of_stops), 2)
    new_tour = list(tour)
    new_tour[i], new_tour[j] = tour[j], tour[i]
    return new_tour
\end{pyin}

Applying this neighbourhood operator to the initial candidate gives:

\begin{pyin}
print(swap_stops(initial_candidate))
\end{pyin}

which swaps the 10th and 12th stops:

\begin{pyout}
[0, 7, 12, 5, 11, 3, 9, 2, 8, 1, 4, 10, 6, 0]
\end{pyout}

Now all the tools are in place to build a tool to carry out the
neighbourhood search \mintinline{python}{run_neighbourhood_search}.

\begin{pyin}
def run_neighbourhood_search(
    distance_matrix,
    iterations,
    seed,
    neighbourhood_operator=swap_stops,
):
    """Returns a tour by carrying out a neighbourhood search.

    Args:
        distance_matrix: the distance matrix
        iterations: the number of iterations for which to
                    run the algorithm
        seed: a random seed
        neighbourhood_operator: the neighbourhood operator
                                (default: swap_stops)

    Returns:
        A tour
    """
    number_of_stops = len(distance_matrix)
    candidate = get_initial_candidate(
        number_of_stops=number_of_stops,
        seed=seed,
    )
    best_cost = get_cost(
        tour=candidate,
        distance_matrix=distance_matrix,
    )
    for _ in range(iterations):
        new_candidate = neighbourhood_operator(candidate)
        cost = get_cost(
            tour=new_candidate,
            distance_matrix=distance_matrix,
        )
        if cost <= best_cost:
            best_cost = cost
            candidate = new_candidate

    return candidate
\end{pyin}

Now running this for 1000 iterations:

\begin{pyin}
number_of_iterations = 1000

solution_with_swap_stops = run_neighbourhood_search(
    distance_matrix=distance_matrix,
    iterations=number_of_iterations,
    seed=seed,
    neighbourhood_operator=swap_stops,
)
print(solution_with_swap_stops)
\end{pyin}

gives:

\begin{pyout}
[0, 7, 2, 8, 5, 3, 1, 9, 12, 11, 4, 10, 6, 0]
\end{pyout}

This has a cost:

\begin{pyin}
cost = get_cost(
    tour=solution_with_swap_stops,
    distance_matrix=distance_matrix,
)
print(cost)
\end{pyin}

\begin{pyout}
362
\end{pyout}

Therefore, using this particular algorithm, a pretty good route is found, with a
total distance of 362.

It is important to note that this may not be the optimal route, and different
algorithms may produce better solutions.
For example, one way to modify the algorithm is to use a different neighbourhood
operator.
Instead of swapping two stops, reverse the path between those two stops. This
corresponds to an algorithm called the ``2-opt''
algorithm\index{2-opt algorithm}.\footnote{The 2-opt algorithm was first
published in~\cite{croes1958method}.}
The \mintinline{python}{reverse_path} function does this:

\begin{pyin}
def reverse_path(tour):
    """Return a new tour by reversing the path between two stops.

    Args:
        tour: A given tuple of successive stops.

    Returns:
        A tour
    """
    number_of_stops = len(tour) - 1
    stops = np.random.choice(range(1, number_of_stops), 2)
    i, j = sorted(stops)
    new_tour = tour[:i] + tour[i : j + 1][::-1] + tour[j + 1 :]
    return new_tour
\end{pyin}

Applying this neighbourhood operator to the initial candidate gives:

\begin{pyin}
print(reverse_path(initial_candidate))
\end{pyin}

which reverses the order between the 3rd and the 11th stop:

\begin{pyout}
[0, 7, 4, 10, 8, 2, 9, 3, 11, 5, 12, 1, 6, 0]
\end{pyout}

Now running the neighbourhood search for 1000 iterations using the
\mintinline{python}{reverse_path} neighbourhood operator:

\begin{pyin}
solution_with_reverse_path = run_neighbourhood_search(
    distance_matrix=distance_matrix,
    iterations=number_of_iterations,
    seed=seed,
    neighbourhood_operator=reverse_path,
)
print(solution_with_reverse_path)
\end{pyin}

gives:

\begin{pyout}
[0, 8, 5, 3, 1, 9, 12, 11, 4, 10, 6, 2, 7, 0]
\end{pyout}

This now gives a different route.
Importantly, the costs differ substantially:

\begin{pyin}
cost = get_cost(
    tour=solution_with_reverse_path,
    distance_matrix=distance_matrix,
)
print(cost)
\end{pyin}

which gives:

\begin{pyout}
299
\end{pyout}

This improves on the solution found using the \mintinline{python}{swap_stops}
operator. Figure~\ref{fig:final-tsp-tours-python} shows the final obtained
routes given by both approaches.

\begin{figure}

    \end{center}
    \caption{The final tours obtained by using the neighbourhood search in
    Python.}
    \label{fig:final-tsp-tours-python}
\end{figure}



\section{Solving with R}\label{sec:heuristics_solving-with-R}

To solve this problem using R, functions will be written that match the
first three steps in the Section~\ref{sec:heuristics_theory}.

The first step is to write the \mintinline{R}{get_initial_candidate}
function that creates an initial tour:

\begin{Rin}
#' Return an random initial tour.
#'
#' @param number_of_stops The number of stops.
#' @param seed An integer seed.
#'
#' @return A tour starting an ending at stop with index 0.
get_initial_candidate <- function(number_of_stops, seed){
  internal_stops <- 1:(number_of_stops - 1)
  set.seed(seed)
  internal_stops <- sample(internal_stops)
  c(0, internal_stops, 0)
}
\end{Rin}

This gives a random tour on 13 stops:

\begin{Rin}
number_of_stops <- 13
seed <- 1
initial_candidate <- get_initial_candidate(
  number_of_stops = number_of_stops,
  seed = seed)
print(initial_candidate)
\end{Rin}

\begin{Rout}
 [1]  0  9  4  7  1  2  5  3  8  6 11 12 10  0
\end{Rout}

To be able to evaluate any given tour its cost must be found. Here
\mintinline{R}{get_cost}  does this:

\begin{Rin}
#' Return the cost of a tour
#'
#' @param tour A given vector of successive stops.
#' @param seed The distance matrix of the problem.
#'
#' @return The cost
get_cost <- function(tour, distance_matrix){
  pairs <-  cbind(tour[-length(tour)], tour[-1]) + 1
  sum(distance_matrix[pairs])
}
\end{Rin}

\begin{Rin}
distance_matrix <- rbind(
        c(0, 35, 35, 29, 70, 35, 42, 27, 24, 44, 58, 71, 69),
        c(35, 0, 67, 32, 72, 40, 71, 56, 36, 11, 66, 70, 37),
        c(35, 67, 0, 63, 64, 68, 11, 12, 56, 77, 48, 67, 94),
        c(29, 32, 63, 0, 93, 8, 71, 56, 8, 33, 84, 93, 69),
        c(70, 72, 64, 93, 0, 101, 56, 56, 92, 81, 16, 5, 69),
        c(35, 40, 68, 8, 101, 0, 76, 62, 11, 39, 91, 101, 76),
        c(42, 71, 11, 71, 56, 76, 0, 15, 65, 81, 40, 60, 94),
        c(27, 56, 12, 56, 56, 62, 15, 0, 50, 66, 41, 58, 82),
        c(24, 36, 56, 8, 92, 11, 65, 50, 0, 39, 81, 91, 74),
        c(44, 11, 77, 33, 81, 39, 81, 66, 39, 0, 77, 79, 37),
        c(58, 66, 48, 84, 16, 91, 40, 41, 81, 77, 0, 20, 73),
        c(71, 70, 67, 93, 5, 101, 60, 58, 91, 79, 20, 0, 65),
        c(69, 37, 94, 69, 69, 76, 94, 82, 74, 37, 73, 65, 0)
)
cost <- get_cost(
  tour = initial_candidate,
  distance_matrix = distance_matrix)
print(cost)
\end{Rin}

\begin{Rout}
[1] 709
\end{Rout}

Now a function for a neighbourhood operator will be written,
\mintinline{R}{swap_stops}: swapping two stops in a given tour.

\begin{Rin}
#' Return a new tour by swapping two stops.
#'
#' @param tour A given vector of successive stops.
#'
#' @return A tour
swap_stops <- function(tour){
  number_of_stops <- length(tour) - 1
  stops_to_swap <- sample(2:number_of_stops, 2)
  new_tour <- replace(
    x = tour,
    list = stops_to_swap,
    values = rev(tour[stops_to_swap])
  )
}
\end{Rin}

Applying this neighbourhood operator to the initial candidate gives:

\begin{Rin}
new_tour <- swap_stops(initial_candidate)
print(new_tour)
\end{Rin}

which swaps the 6th and 11th stops:

\begin{Rout}
 [1]  0  9  4  7  1 11  5  3  8  6  2 12 10  0
\end{Rout}

Now all the tools are in place to build a tool to carry out the
neighbourhood search \mintinline{R}{run_neighbourhood_search}.

\begin{Rin}
#' Returns a tour by carrying out a neighbourhood search
#'
#' @param distance_matrix: the distance matrix
#' @param iterations: the number of iterations for
#'                    which to run the algorithm
#' @param seed: a random seed (default: None)
#' @param neighbourhood_operator: the neighbourhood operation
#'                                (default: swap_stops)
#'
#' @return A tour
run_neighbourhood_search <- function(
  distance_matrix,
  iterations,
  seed = NA,
  neighbourhood_operator = swap_stops
){
  number_of_stops <- nrow(distance_matrix)
  candidate <- get_initial_candidate(
    number_of_stops = number_of_stops,
    seed = seed
  )
  best_cost <- get_cost(
    tour = candidate,
    distance_matrix = distance_matrix
  )
  for (repetition in 1:iterations) {
    new_candidate <- neighbourhood_operator(candidate)
    cost <- get_cost(
        tour = new_candidate,
        distance_matrix = distance_matrix
    )
    if (cost <= best_cost) {
      best_cost <- cost
      candidate <- new_candidate
    }
  }
  candidate
}
\end{Rin}

Now running this for 1000 iterations:

\begin{Rin}
number_of_iterations <- 1000
solution_with_swap_stops <- run_neighbourhood_search(
  distance_matrix = distance_matrix,
  iterations = number_of_iterations,
  seed = seed,
  neighbourhood_operator = swap_stops
)
print(solution_with_swap_stops)
\end{Rin}

gives:

\begin{Rout}
 [1]  0 11  4 10  6  2  7 12  9  1  3  5  8  0
\end{Rout}

This has a cost:

\begin{Rin}
cost <- get_cost(
  tour = solution_with_swap_stops,
  distance_matrix = distance_matrix
)
print(cost)
\end{Rin}

which gives:

\begin{Rout}
[1] 360
\end{Rout}

Therefore, using this particular algorithm, a pretty good route is found, with a
total distance of 360.

It is important to note that this may not be the optimal route, and different
algorithms may produce better solutions.
For example, one way to modify the algorithm is to use a different neighbourhood
operator.
Instead of swapping two stops, reverse the path between those two stops. This
corresponds to an algorithm called the ``2-opt''
algorithm\index{2-opt algorithm}.\footnote{The 2 opt algorithm was first
published in~\cite{croes1958method}.}
The \mintinline{R}{reverse_path} function does this:


\begin{Rin}
#' Return a new tour by reversing the path between two stops.
#'
#' @param tour A given vector of successive stops.
#'
#' @return A tour
reverse_path <- function(tour){
  number_of_stops <- length(tour) - 1
  stops_to_swap <- sample(2:number_of_stops, 2)
  i <- min(stops_to_swap)
  j <- max(stops_to_swap)
  new_order <- c(c(1: (i - 1)), c(j:i), c( (j + 1): length(tour)))
  tour[new_order]
}
\end{Rin}

Applying this neighbourhood operator to the initial candidate gives:

\begin{Rin}
new_tour <- reverse_path(initial_candidate)
print(new_tour)
\end{Rin}

which reverses the order
between the 3rd and the 13th stop:

\begin{Rout}
 [1]  0  9 10 12 11  6  8  3  5  2  1  7  4  0
\end{Rout}

Now running the neighbourhood search for 1000 iterations using the
\mintinline{R}{reverse_path} neighbourhood operator:

\begin{Rin}
number_of_iterations <- 1000
solution_with_reverse_path <- run_neighbourhood_search(
  distance_matrix = distance_matrix,
  iterations = number_of_iterations,
  seed = seed,
  neighbourhood_operator = reverse_path
)
print(solution_with_reverse_path)
\end{Rin}

gives:

\begin{Rout}
 [1]  0  7  2  6 10  4 11 12  9  1  3  5  8  0
\end{Rout}

This now gives a different route.
Importantly, the costs differ substantially:

\begin{Rin}
cost <- get_cost(
  tour = solution_with_reverse_path,
  distance_matrix = distance_matrix
)
print(cost)
\end{Rin}

which gives:

\begin{Rout}
[1] 299
\end{Rout}

This is an improvement on the solution found using the \mintinline{R}{swap_stops}
operator. Figure~\ref{fig:final-tsp-tours-r} shows the final obtained routes
given by both approaches.

\section{Wider context}\label{sec:heuristics_wider_context}

Heuristic methods, sometimes referred to as meta-heuristics, are a whole family
of algorithms used to find approximate solutions to combinatorial optimisation
problems. An overview is given in~\cite{bozorg2017meta}. These algorithms
include greedy searches, tabu searches\index{tabu search}, simulated
annealing\index{simulated annealing}, genetic algorithms\index{genetic algorithm},
as well \index{ant colony optimisation}. They are usually employed when the
problem is too large or complex to use exact methodologies.

The travelling salesman problem, described in this chapter, is a classic example
of one of these problems, formally described first in~\cite{menger1932},
although thought to have been discussed informally centuries before.
It is an example of a large number of types of problems collectively known as
vehicle routing problems, which often require heuristic methods for their
solutions. A survey is given in~\cite{braekers2016vehicle}. Variations of
the problem include multiple, heterogeneous and/or capacitated vehicles, and
stochastic or time-dependent travel times. A recent adaptation of the problem
is the green vehicle routing
problem\index{green vehicle routing problem}~\cite{moghdani2021green}, where the
cost function includes consideration of green house gas emissions and other
pollutants.

For more diverse applications of heuristic methods,
consider~\cite{lewis2016creating} which describes a tabu search algorithm
for finding seating plans for a wedding; and \cite{tong2013modeling} where
a genetic algorithm is used to build a prediction model for locations of
deep-sea wildlife habitats.
