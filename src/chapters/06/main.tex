\chapterinitial{M}{ost} of the time when modelling certain situations two
approaches are valid: to make assumptions about the overall behaviour or to make
assumptions about the detailed behaviour. The later can be thought of as
measuring emergent behaviour. One tool used to do this is the study of
interactive  decision making: game theory.

\section{Problem}\label{sec:problem}

Consider a city council. Two electric taxi companies are going to move in to
the city and the city wants to ensure that the customers are best served by this
new duopoly. The two taxi firms will be deciding how many vehicles to deploy:
one, two or three. The city wants to encourage them to both use three as this
ensures the highest level of availability to the population.

Some exploratory data analysis gives the following insights:

\begin{itemize}
    \item If both companies use the same number of taxis then they make the same
        profit which will go down slightly as the number of taxis goes up.
    \item If one company uses more taxis than the other then they make more
        profit.
\end{itemize}

The expected profits for Taxi Company A are given in Table~\ref{tbl:profit-of-taxi-companies}.
The profits for Taxi Company B are the same.

% TODO I tried to make the table look better and more readable. Feel free to revert. I don't like that the horizontal and vertical lines don't touch. The column names were confusing, so I made them refer to specific companies now.


Given these expected profits, the council wants to understand what is likely to
happen and potentially give a financial incentive to each company to ensure
their behaviour is in the population's interest.
This would take the form of a fixed increase to the companies' profits,
\(\epsilon\), to be found, if they put on three taxis, shown in

\section{Theory}\label{sec:theory}

In the case of this city, the interaction can be modelled using a mathematical
object called a game, which here requires:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item A given collection of actors that make decisions (players);
    \item Options available to each player (actions);
    \item A numerical value associated to each player for every possible
        choice of action made by all the players. This is the utility or reward.
\end{enumerate}

This is called a normal form game and is formally defined by:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item A finite set of \(N\) players;
    \item Action spaces for each player: \(\{A_1, A_2, A_3, \dots, A_N\}\);
    \item Utility functions that for each player \(u_1, u_2, u_3, \dots, u_N\)
        where \(u_i:A_1\times A_2 \times A_3 \dots A_N \to \mathbb{R}\).
\end{enumerate}

When \(N=2\) the utility function is often represented by a pair of matrices (1
for each player) of with the same number of rows and columns. The rows
correspond to the actions available to the first player and the columns to the
actions available to the second player.

Given a pair of actions (a row and column) we can read the utilities to both
player by looking at the corresponding entry of the corresponding matrix.

For this example, the two matrices would be:

\[
   M =
        \begin{pmatrix}
            1     & 1 / 2   & 1 / 3 \\
            3 / 2 & 19 / 20 & 1 / 2 \\
            5 / 3 & 4 / 5   & 17 / 20\\
        \end{pmatrix}
   \qquad
   N = M ^T =
        \begin{pmatrix}
            1     & 3 / 2   & 5 / 3 \\
            1 / 2 & 19 / 20 & 4 / 5 \\
            1 / 3 & 1 / 2   & 17 / 20\\
        \end{pmatrix}
\]

A diagram of the system is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:taxi-firm-game}

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includestandalone[width=.8\textwidth]{./assets/taxi-firm-game/main}
\end{center}
\caption{Diagrammatic representation of the action sets and payoff matrices for
    the game.}
\label{fig:taxi-firm-game}
\end{figure}

A strategy corresponds to an way of choosing actions, this is represented by a
probability vector. For the \(i\)th player, this vector \(v\) would be of size
\(|A_i|\) (the size of the action space) and \(v_i\) corresponds to the
probability of choosing the \(i\)th action.

Both taxis always choosing to use 2 taxis (the second row/column) would
correspond to the strategy: \((0, 1, 0)\).
If the both companies use this strategy and the row player (who controls the
rows) wants to improve their outcome it's evident by inspecting the second
column that the highest number is \(19 / 20\): thus the row player has no reason
to change what they are doing.

This is called a Nash equilibrium: when both players are playing a
strategy that is the best response against the other.

Whilst a Nash equilibrium is not necessarily a set of strategies that players
will converge towards, once they are there they have no reason to move away from
it. It is the particular concept that will be used to understand the emergent
behaviour in the city.

% TODO I don't thnk this last paragraph is needed, or makes sense in this context. We don't yet know what you mean by 'converge', we don't have any concept of repeating a game and learning from the outcomes etc.

% TODO Having said that, I don't think there is enough theory here, especially compared to other chapters, e.g. the LP chapter or the DES chapter. We do not know how to find a Nash equilibrium. We don't know if a Nash equilibrium necessarily exists. Can something else be added?

\section{Solving with Python}\label{sec:solving-with-python}

The first step we will take is to write a function to create a game using the
matrix expected profits. The Nashpy library will be used for this.

\begin{pyin}
import nashpy as nash


def get_game(profits):
    """Return the game object.

    Args:
        profits: a matrix with expected profits

    Returns:
        A nashpy game object
    """
    return nash.Game(profits, profits.T)
\end{pyin}

This gives the game for the the considered problem:

\begin{pyin}
import numpy as np

profits = np.array(
    (
        (1, 1 / 2, 1 / 3),
        (3 / 2, 19 / 20, 1 / 2),
        (5 / 3, 4 / 5, 17 / 20),
    )
)
game = get_game(profits=profits)
print(game)
\end{pyin}

which gives:

\begin{pyout}
Bi matrix game with payoff matrices:

Row player:
[[1.         0.5        0.33333333]
 [1.5        0.95       0.5       ]
 [1.66666667 0.8        0.85      ]]

Column player:
[[1.         1.5        1.66666667]
 [0.5        0.95       0.8       ]
 [0.33333333 0.5        0.85      ]]
\end{pyout}

Now any Nash equilibria of this game can be found, showing what stable
behaviours might emerge:

\begin{pyin}
for eq in game.support_enumeration():
    print(eq)
\end{pyin}

% TODO should this be a function?
% edit: it is below. I think the two functions below should be defined first, and used to show the case with no offset.

which gives:

\begin{pyout}
(array([0., 1., 0.]), array([0., 1., 0.]))
(array([0., 0., 1.]), array([0., 0., 1.]))
(array([0. , 0.7, 0.3]), array([0. , 0.7, 0.3]))
\end{pyout}

There are 3 Nash equilibria: 3 possible pairs of behaviour that the two
companies might converge to.

\begin{itemize}
    \item The first equilibrium \(((0, 1, 0), (0, 1, 0))\) corresponds to both
          firms always using 2 taxis;
    \item The second equilibrium \(((0, 0, 1), (0, 0, 1))\) corresponds to both
          firms always using 3 taxis;
    \item The third equilibrium \(((0, 0.7, 0.3), (0, 0.7, 0.3))\) corresponds to
          both firms using 2 taxis 70\% of the time and 3 taxis otherwise.
\end{itemize}

A good thing to note is that the two taxi companies will never only provide a
single taxi (which would be harmful to the customers).

However, the council would like to offset the cost of using 3 taxis in order to
encourage the taxi company to provide a better service. This involves modifying
the \mintinline{python}{get_game} function as follows:

\begin{pyin}
def get_game(profits, offset):
    """Return the game object with a given offset when 3 taxis
    are provided.

    Args:
        profits: a matrix with expected profits
        offset: a float

    Returns:
        A nashpy game object
    """
    new_profits = np.array(profits)
    new_profits[2] += offset
    return nash.Game(new_profits, new_profits.T)
\end{pyin}

% TODO why don't we use this function from the beginning, setting offset=0? This saves having two different functions doing the same thing, and seems neater. It also follows what we've done in other chapters, e.g. vaccinations.

The function \mintinline{python}{get_equilibria} which will directly compute the
equilibria:

\begin{pyin}
def get_equilibria(profits, offset):
    """Return the equilibria for a given offset when 3 taxis
    are provided.

    Args:
        profits: a matrix with expected profits
        offset: a float

    Returns:
        A tuple of Nash equilibria
    """
    game = get_game(profits=profits, offset=offset)
    return tuple(game.support_enumeration())
\end{pyin}

This can be used to find the number of Nash equilibria for a given offset and
stop when there is a single equilibrium:

\begin{pyin}
offset = 0
while len(get_equilibria(profits=profits, offset=offset)) > 1:
    offset += 0.01
\end{pyin}

This gives a final offset value of:

\begin{pyin}
print(round(offset, 2))
\end{pyin}


\begin{pyout}
0.15
\end{pyout}

and now confirm that the Nash equilibrium is where both taxi firms provide
three vehicles:

\begin{pyin}
print(tuple(get_equilibria(profits=profits, offset=offset)))
\end{pyin}

giving:

\begin{pyout}
((array([0., 0., 1.]), array([0., 0., 1.])),)
\end{pyout}

Therefore, in order to ensure that the maximum amount of taxis are used, the
council should offer a \(\pounds 0.15\) per hour incentive to both taxi
companies for putting on 3 taxis.

\section{Solving with R}\label{sec:solving-with-R}

R does not have a single appropriate library for the game considered here, we
will choose to use \mintinline{R}{Recon} which has functionality for finding the
Nash equilibria for two player games when only considering pure strategies
(where the players only choose to use a single action at a time).

\begin{Rin}
library(Recon)

#' Returns the equilibria in pure strategies
#'
#' @param profits: a matrix with expected profits
#'
#' @return a list of equilibria
get_equilibria <- function(profits){
    sim_nasheq(profits, t(profits))
}
\end{Rin}

This gives the pure Nash equilibria:

\begin{Rin}

profits <- rbind(
        c(1, 1 / 2, 1 / 3),
        c(3 / 2, 19 / 20, 1 / 2),
        c(5 / 3, 4 / 5, 17 / 20)
    )
eqs <- get_equilibria(profits = profits)
print(eqs)
\end{Rin}

which gives:

\begin{Rout}
$`Equilibrium 1`
[1] "2" "2"

$`Equilibrium 2`
[1] "3" "3"

\end{Rout}

There are 2 pure Nash equilibria: 2 possible pairs of behaviour that the two
companies might converge to.

\begin{itemize}
    \item The first equilibrium \(((0, 1, 0), (0, 1, 0))\) corresponds to both
          firms always using 2 taxis;
    \item The second equilibrium \(((0, 0, 1), (0, 0, 1))\) corresponds to both
          firms always using 3 taxis.
\end{itemize}

There is in fact a third Nash equilibrium where both taxi firms use 2 taxis 70\%
of the time and 3 taxis the rest of the time but \mintinline{R}{Recon} is unable
to find Nash equilibria with mixed behaviour for games with more than two
strategies.

As an aside, if the option of using a single taxi is removed then
\mintinline{R}{Recon} can give all three equilibria by passing the
\mintinline{R}{type = "mixed"} argument to \mintinline{R}{sim_nasheq}.

A good thing to note is that the two taxi
companies will not only provide a single taxi (which would be harmful to the
customers).

% TODO I don't like these two paragraphs. They only make sense if you have read the Python section. Without reading the Python section, we do not know that no mixed equilibria use a single taxi, so removing that column feels like a stretch.
% Can we just note that another mixed equilibrium exists but that it cannot be computed with this library? Maybe we can add the rest as a footnote? But here it feels forced.

As discussed, the council would like to offset the cost of 3
taxis so as to encourage the taxi company to provide a better service. This
involves modifying the \mintinline{R}{get_equilibria} function as follows:


\begin{Rin}
#' Returns the equilibria in pure strategies
#' for a given offset
#'
#' @param profits: a matrix with expected profits
#' @param offset: a float
#'
#' @return a list of equilibria
get_equilibria <- function(profits, offset){
    new_profits <- rbind(
                profits[c(1, 2), ],
                profits[3, ] + offset)
    sim_nasheq(new_profits, t(new_profits))
}
\end{Rin}

% TODO Similar to Python, can't we use this from the start, and set offset=0?

This gives the number of equilibria for a given offset and stop when there is a
single equilibrium:

\begin{Rin}
offset <- 0
while (length(
            get_equilibria(profits = profits, offset = offset)
            ) > 1){
    offset <- offset + 0.01
}
\end{Rin}

This gives a final offset value of:

\begin{Rin}
print(round(offset, 2))
\end{Rin}

\begin{Rout}
[1] 0.15
\end{Rout}

and now confirm that the Nash equilibrium is where both taxi firms provide
three vehicles:

\begin{Rin}
print(get_equilibria(profits = profits, offset = offset))
\end{Rin}

giving:

\begin{Rout}
$`Equilibrium 1`
[1] "3" "3"
\end{Rout}

Therefore, in order to ensure that the maximum amount of taxis are used, the
council should offer a \(\pounds 0.15\) per hour incentive to both taxi
companies for putting on 3 taxis.
