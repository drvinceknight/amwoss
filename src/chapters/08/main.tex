% Introduction
\chapterinitial{F}{inding} the best configuration of some system can be
challenging, especially when there is a seemingly endless amount of possible
solutions. Optimisation techniques are a way to mathematically derive solutions
that maximise or minimise some objective function, subject to a number of
feasibility constraints. When all components of the problem can be written in a
linear way, then linear programming is one technique that can be used to find
the solution.

\section{Problem}\label{sec:problem}
A university runs 26 modules over four subjects: Art, Biology, Chemistry, and
Dutch. Each subject runs core modules and optional modules.
Table~\ref{tab:modules} gives the module numbers for each of these.

\label{tab:modules}
\end{table}

The university is required to schedule examinations for each of these modules.
The university would like the exams to be schedules using the least amount of
time slots possible. However not all modules can be scheduled at the same time
as they share some students:

\begin{itemize}
  \item All art modules share students,
  \item All biology modules share students,
  \item All chemistry modules share students,
  \item All Dutch modules share students,
  \item Art students have the option of taking the core Dutch modules, and so
  all art modules may share students with core Dutch modules,
  \item Biology students have the option of taking optional modules from
  chemistry, so all biology modules may share students with optional chemistry
  modules,
  \item Chemistry students have the option of taking optional modules from
  biology, so all chemistry modules may share students with optional biology
  modules,
  \item Biology students have the option of taking core art modules, and so all
  biology modules may share students with core art modules.
\end{itemize}

What is the least number of exam time slots required to hold all 26 exams with
no clashes?


\section{Theory}\label{sec:theory}
Linear programming is a method that solves an optimisation problem of $n$
variables by defining all constraints as planes in $n$-dimensional space. These
planes combine to create a convex region where all feasible solutions (those
that satisfy the constrains) lie within the convex region, and all infeasible
solutions (those that break at least one constraint) lie outside this convex
region.

As we are interested in optimising some linear function, that is either
minimising or maximising some function, the solution must lie at the very edge
of the feasible convex region. That is we have improved so much that if we were
to improve any further we would lie outside the feasible region - hence the
optimum lies on the edge.

Linear programming employs algorithms such as the Simplex method to
mathematically traverse the edges of the feasible convex region, and stops at
the optimum. Therefore we only need to define out objective function and
constraints in a linear fashion, and then apply appropriate algorithms.

Consider a 2-dimensional example: I am able to make $\pounds 50$ profit on each
tonne of paint A I produce, and $\pounds 60$ profit on each tonne of paint B I
produce. A tonne of paint A needs 4 tonnes of ingredient X and 5 tonnes of
ingredient Y. A tonne of paint B needs 6 tonnes of ingredient X and 4 tonnes of
ingredient Y. Only 24 tonnes of X and 20 tonnes of Y available per day. How much
of paint A and paint B should I produce daily to maximise profit?

This is formulated as a linear objective function (total profit) to maximise,
and two linear constraints (availability of ingredients X and Y). They are
written as:

\begin{align}
\text{Maximise: } 50 A + 60 B & \\\label{eqn:objective}
\text{Subject to: } & \nonumber \\
4 A + 6 B &\leq 24 \\\label{eqn:ingredientX}
5 A + 4 B &\leq 20 \label{eqn:ingredientY}
\end{align}

Now we have a linear system in 2-dimensional space with coordinates A and B.
These are called the decision variables, whose values we wish to find that
optimises the objective given by expression~\ref{eqn:objective}.
Inequalities~\ref{eqn:ingredientX} and~\ref{eqn:ingredientY} correspond to the
amount of ingredient X and Y available per day. These, along with the additional
constraints that we cannot produce a negative amount of paint
($A \geq 0$ and $B \geq 0$), form the convex feasible region shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:paint_lp}.

\begin{figure}

\caption{Visual representation of the paint linear program. The feasible convex
region is shaded in grey; the objective function with arbitrary value is shown
in a dashed line.}
\label{fig:paint_lp}
\end{figure}

Expression~\ref{eqn:objective} corresponds to the total profit, which is the
expression we are trying to maximise. As a line in the 2-dimensional space, this
expression fixes its gradient, but its value determines the size of the
$y$-intercept. Therefore optimising this function corresponds to pushing a line
with that gradient to its furthest extreme within the feasible region,
demonstrated in Figure~\ref{paint_lp}.
Therefore for this problem the optimum occurs in a particular vertex of the
feasible region, at $A = \frac{12}{7}$ and $B = \frac{20}{7}$.

This works well is $A$ and $B$ can take any real value in the feasible region.
It is common however to formulate Integer Linear Programmes where the decision
variables are restricted to integers. There are a number of methods that can
help us adapt a real solution to an integer solution. These include cutting
planes, which introduce new constraints around the real solution to force an
integer value; and branch and bound methods, where we iteratively convert
decision variables to their closest two integers and remove any infeasible
solutions.

Both Python and R have libraries that carry out the linear and integer
programming algorithms for us. When solving these kinds of problems, formulating
them as linear systems is the most important challenge.

Consider again the exam scheduling problem from Section~\ref{sec:problem}.
There are eight distinct sets of modules in which exams cannot be scheduled
simultaneously: $A_c$, $A_o$ representing core and optional art modules
respectively; $B_c$, $B_o$ representing core and optional biology modules
respectively; $C_c$, $C_o$ representing core and optional chemistry modules
respectively; and $D_c$, $D_o$ representing core and optional Dutch modules
respectively.

\begin{figure}

\includestandalone[width=0.75\textwidth]{assets/clashes}
\end{center}
\caption{Visualisation of sets of modules with shared students.}
\label{fig:clashes}
\end{figure}

Additionally there are further clashes between these sets, this can be
visualised as a graph, shown in Figure~\ref{fig:clashes} where edges between
sets represent shared students.
This shows there are five cliques (shown in red, blue, green, orange and
yellow), that is five larger sets of modules that may share students:
$C_o \cup C_c \cup B_o$, $C_o \cup B_o \cup B_c$, $B_c \cup B_o \cup A_c$,
$A_c \cup A_o \cup D_c$, and $D_c \cup D_o$. These sets of modules will form the
basis for out constraints, Inequalities~\ref{eqn:clique1} to~\ref{eqn:clique5}.

Define $M$ as the set of all modules to be schedules, that is
$M = A_c \cup A_o \cup B_c \cup B_o \cup C_c \cup C_o \cup D_c \cup D_o$.
Define also $T$ as the set of possible time slots. At worst each exam is
scheduled for a different day, thus $|T| = |M| = 26$ in this case.
Let $\{X_{mt} \text{ for } m \in M \text{ and } t \in T\}$ be a set of binary
decision variables, that is $X_{mt}$ is 1 if module $m$ is scheduled for time
$t$, and 0 otherwise.
Let's also define $\{Y_t \text{ for } t \in T\}$ as a set of auxiliary binary
decision variables, where $Y_t$ is 1 if time slot $t$ is being used. This is
enforced by Inequality~\ref{eqn:auxiliary}.

Finally we have one final constraint, Inequality~\ref{eqn:schedule_all_modules},
which ensures all modules are scheduled once and once only.
Thus altogether our integer program becomes:

\begin{align}
\text{Minimise: } \sum_{t \in T} Y_j & \\
\text{Subject to: } & \nonumber \\
\frac{1}{|M|} \sum_{m \in M} X_{mt} &\leq Y_j \text{ for all } j \in T\\\label{eqn:auxiliary}
\sum_{t \in T} X_{mt} &= 1 \text{ for all } m \in M\\\label{eqn:schedule_all_modules}
\sum_{m \in C_o \cup C_c \cup B_o} X_{mt} &\leq 1 \text{ for all } t \in T\\\label{eqn:clique1}
\sum_{m \in C_o \cup B_o \cup B_c} X_{mt} &\leq 1 \text{ for all } t \in T\\\label{eqn:clique2}
\sum_{m \in B_c \cup B_o \cup A_c} X_{mt} &\leq 1 \text{ for all } t \in T\\\label{eqn:clique3}
\sum_{m \in A_c \cup A_o \cup D_c} X_{mt} &\leq 1 \text{ for all } t \in T\\\label{eqn:clique4}
\sum_{m \in D_c \cup D_o} X_{mt} & \leq 1 \text{ for all } t \in T\\\label{eqn:clique5}
\end{align}
