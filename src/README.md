# Editorial principles

## Who is this book for?

## Contents of sections

### Introduction

> If I know nothing about the topic and read this paragraph I will know a
> surface description of the problem type and the name of the solution approach.

### Typical Problem

> A brief (but comprehensive) description of a typical problem. If I do not know
> anything about the subject matter I can understand the problem and the problem
> parameters. If I **do** know the subject matter I should be able to solve the
> problem.

### Theory

- Discuss some theoretic principles (some basic technical language is acceptable)
- Use a smaller example (different to the typical problem) that can be done by
  hand.
- Some theoretic concepts might be illustrated using the typical problem.

###Â Code

- Give a brief (blog post style) overview of using each langauge to solve the
problem.
- A functional approach is used: everything is embedded in functions that are
  called. Justification/explanation of this will be written in "about this book
  section" (documentation, modularity and testability are the justification).

#### Solving with Python

#### Solving with R

## Language

- Avoid we/I.
- In DES chapter we used digits for numbers (1, 2, 3 ... etc instead of one,
  two, three).
- Dice is plural, die is singular.
- Itemized, enumerated lists have `,` at the end and `.` at the end of the last
  item.
- In text: Names of libraries are in plain text and capitalized.

## Research highlights

> If I was undertaking a research project in this field, reading these three
> papers would be a good starting point to build the literature.
